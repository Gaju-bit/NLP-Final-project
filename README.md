# NLP-Final-project
This is a project that has to do with developing neural network models which can provide the
sentiment of text in various African languages.
I utilized RNN-based sentiment analysis models, specifically LSTM, for Nigerian languages, including Igbo, 
Hausa, and Nigerian Pidgin English, as they have been proven to be more accurate in previous studies. 
Once the model has been trained, I assessed its performance on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters such
as the learning rate, batch size, and a number of epochs. 
This approach is essential to avoid overfitting and boost the overall performance of the model. By leveraging these techniques,
I achieved accurate and reliable sentiment analysis results for the Nigerian languages I am targeting in my NLP Project.
