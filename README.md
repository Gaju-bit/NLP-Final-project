# NLP-Final-project
After thorough research and careful consideration, I have successfully cleared up my confusion regarding my NLP Project. 
I have decided to utilize RNN-based sentiment analysis models, specifically LSTM, for Nigerian languages, including Igbo, 
Hausa, and Nigerian Pidgin English, as they have been proven to be more accurate in previous studies. 
Once the model has been trained, I plan to assess its performance on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters such
as the learning rate, batch size, and a number of epochs. 
This approach is essential to avoid overfitting and boost the overall performance of the model. By leveraging these techniques,
I am confident in achieving accurate and reliable sentiment analysis results for the Nigerian languages I am targeting in my NLP Project.
